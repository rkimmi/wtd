# HTML Elements (aka Tags)
<h1>Hello world!</h1>
<em>I am emphasised!</em>

Sometimes there is no closing tag;
I'm on one line.<br>
And I'm on the next line.

How 'bout a sweet horizontal rule?<hr>

# HTML attributes 
<img src="" alt="">

VIDEO FIX

#CSS 
#style tag  

 then -> <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="main.css" />

selectors -> h1 selects all h1 tags

A really popular way to select elements is to assign them a class and then target the classes in your selection. 

#<div></div>
The first step is to assign a class to an element.

You can add as many as you like just by separating them with a space.

#Declarations

Declarations are made up of the style you want to change and the style's new value.
